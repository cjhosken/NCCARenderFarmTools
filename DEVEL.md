# Development for the NCCARenderFarm
You're interested in development, good on you! This program should be a good challenge for you to work on, and hopefully you'll be able to make it grow.

## Rules
1. Be respectful of others, this is a chance for you all to learn.
2. Don't leave broken code. If you break something, fix it! Or undo the changes you've made.
3. Try to document!

## Documentation
I've tried to make the code as well documented as possible, and I plead you do the same (for the sake of others). If you get stuck understanding a concept, ChatGPT is extremely useful.

## Where do I start? / Github Issue Page
If you're new to development and want to help, but don't know what to do, a good place to start would be looking at the [issues page](https://github.com/cjhosken/NCCARenderFarmTools/issues) on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cjhosken/NCCARenderFarmTools).

There likely will be issues with the software that users need solving. Labels may need to be assigned to different issues, but hopefully users will figure that out.

All problems labelled ```low-priority-task``` are ones that should be simple fixes. If you want to challenge yourself, look at issues labelled `bug` or `feature`. Anything labelled `waiting-on-it` are things that IT needs to deal with. Sending an email to IT about it is a good place to get started on that.

## IT Issues
When you come across issues with IT, such as not having the correct software versions installed, and similar things like that, please be patient with them. It may take a while for them to fufill your requests.

## Support
If you get very stuck, the lecturers are bound to help you with your coding problems. Otherwise, Google and ChatGPT are very viable options for writing you code.
