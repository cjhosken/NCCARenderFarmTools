Then, navigate over to the NCCARenderFarm folder.

Double click on the setup.sh, this should open up a terminal and begin installing dependencies. Once finished, it will automatically close.

You can double click on `launch.sh`

If double clicking opens the file, you can right click and `Git bash here`.

### Linux

Setup for linux is much simpler. Navigate to the app folder, open a terminal, and run `./setup.sh` to setup the NCCA Renderfarm Tool. This may take a couple minutes, but once done, you'll never have to run setup.sh again.

Then, run `launch.sh` to start the program. You can do so from the terminal or by right clicking and choosing `Open > Run` or `Run in Terminal`
