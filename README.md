# NCCARenderFarmTools
The NCCA RenderFarm Tools allow users to interact with the NCCA Renderfarm. 
This repository currently contains two tools. Currently, the tools only support:

 - Maya (CPU Only)
 - Houdini (CPU Only)

## Shelf Tools
The shelf tools can be run from inside DCCs (Digital Content Creators).


### Installation
To install the shelf tools, navigate to `/shelf_tools` and run either `linux_setup.sh` or `windows_setup.sh`. The tools should then install into all Houdini and Maya distributions.


### Usage
//TODO


## Standalone Application
The standalone application allows users to manage their renderfarm. They can submit projects, download files, and structure their farm however they want.

### Installation
To install the standalone application, navigate to `/standalone` and run either `linux_setup.sh` or `windows_setup.sh`. The app should then install. 

To run the app, navigate to `/standalone/dist/main` and run the `main` executable.

### Usage
//TODO

## Management

### Issues
The app can be buggy at times, so do be patient. If you feel that It's slowing down or something unusual is happening. Try restarting. If it keeps happening, report a bug either through the UI or at https://github.com/cjhosken/NCCARenderFarmTools/issues.

It's very important you report any bugs you face otherwise they likely will never get fixed. When you report a bug, try and assign a label to it. Do not create any new labels.

## Development
This project is open source, which means anyone can participate in development! I hope that this tool will be passed along by students, and maintained by them while they're at University.

If you wish to get involved with development, read [DEVEL.md](DEVEL.md)

This software was initially developed by me, Christopher Hosken, in the summer of 2024.
