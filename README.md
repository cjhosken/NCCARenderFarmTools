Choose a path to store the script, then extract it and dive inside.

### Building the Application

Run the setup script (either `windows_setup.bat`, `linux_setup.sh`). This will build the tools for you. It takes a couple minutes, so sit tight.

One the script is a complete, you'll see a `launch` executable appear. Running that should run the NCCRenderFarm.

Once complete, you wont need to run the setup file again. You can also move the NCCARenderFarmTools folder wherever you like.

On linux, storing it somewhere like `home/s5605094/ncca/NCCARenderFarmTools` is a good place.

On windows, storing it in your `H://` drive is recommended, as then you wont need to rebuilt it for each lab machine you sign into.
