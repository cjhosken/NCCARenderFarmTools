# NCCA RenderFarm Tools
The NCCA Renderfarm Tools allow users to interact with the NCCA Renderfarm. The shelf tools can be run from inside DCCs (Digital Content Creators). Currently, the shelf tools only support:

 - Maya
    - Maya Software Render
    - ~~Arnold (CPU)~~ (Watermarked)
    - ~~VRay (CPU)~~ (License Errors)

 - Houdini
    - Mantra
    - Karma (CPU)


## Installation
To install the shelf tools, navigate to `shelf_tools/` and run either `linux_setup.sh` or `windows_setup.sh`. The tools should then install into all Houdini and Maya distributions.


## Usage
//TODO

## Issues
The app can be buggy at times, so do be patient. If you feel that It's slowing down or something unusual is happening. Try restarting. If it keeps happening, report a bug either through the UI or at https://github.com/cjhosken/NCCARenderFarmTools/issues.

It's very important you report any bugs you face otherwise they likely will never get fixed. When you report a bug, try and assign a label to it. Do not create any new labels.

## Development
This project is open source, which means anyone can participate in development! I hope that this tool will be passed along by students, and maintained by them while they're at University.

If you wish to get involved with development, read [DEVEL.md](DEVEL.md)
